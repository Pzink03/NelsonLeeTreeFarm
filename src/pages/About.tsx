                                    The owners/managers of Nelson Lee Tree Farm, LLC are local, originally from Lexington, Kentucky, eventually transplanting to Southern Woodford County where they now find themselves deeply rooted on a 30+ acre farm on the corner of Troy Pike (Hwy 33) and Cummins Ferry Road.
<br></br>
<br></br>
What began as a dream, a vision, lots of prayer, moments of uncertainty and admittedly some doubt, the tree farm turned into a reality with lots of hard work and the blessings of God!
<br></br>
<br></br>
The owner has worked in a few of the local garden centers over the years and on his previous mini-farm, planted and maintained various trees and shrubs while managing vegetable gardens with modest success. This tree farm is a new kind of business, but he has significant experience in other business ventures.
